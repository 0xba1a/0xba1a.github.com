# Balakumaran Kannan
Welcome to my blog! :wave:

I'm Balakumaran Kannan, a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft.

With a background as a Linux Systems Engineer, I've recently embarked on an exciting journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence. My current focus lies at the intersection of these domainsâ€”exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) can better understand Linux code to enhance developer productivity and streamline the development process.

As a Stable Maintainer of Azure Linux (Microsoft's in-house Linux distribution), I bring hands-on experience with enterprise-grade Linux systems. Through this blog, I share my learnings, insights, and discoveries as I navigate the evolving landscape of technology.
